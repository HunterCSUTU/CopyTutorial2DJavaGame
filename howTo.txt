javac -d bin src/main/*.java
java -cp bin main.Main

/*
* IMPORTANT IDEA: Java runs CLASSES, not files.
*
* When compiling:
*   javac works with FILE PATHS.
*   Example:
*     javac -d bin src/main/*.java
*
* This means:
*   - Read .java files from src/main/
   - Compile them
   - Put the .class files into bin/
*   - Recreate the package structure inside bin/
*
* After compiling, the structure looks like:
*
*   bin/
*     └── main/
*         ├── Main.class
*         └── GamePanel.class
*
* ------------------------------------------------
*
* When running:
*   java does NOT take file paths.
*   java runs a CLASS using its FULL PACKAGE NAME.
*
* Example:
*   java -cp bin main.Main
*
* Breakdown:
*   -cp bin
*     -> "bin" is the ROOT of the classpath
*     -> Java starts looking for packages here
*
*   main.Main
*     -> "main" is the package (folder inside bin)
*     -> "Main" is the class name (Main.class)
*
* Java internally resolves this as:
*   bin + main.Main
*   => bin/main/Main.class
*
* ------------------------------------------------
*
* THIS IS WHY YOU DO NOT DO:
*   java -cp bin/main/Main     (wrong)
*   java Main                 (wrong if using packages)
*
* File paths are for javac.
* Package.ClassName is for java.
*
* RULE TO REMEMBER:
*   "Compile with paths, run with package names."
